# ðŸŒŽ The presentation we used at the ISS course

This was made by me and Darius, a colleague from my team, to which I want to thank.

I made this repository to serve as an everlasting memory of the presentation that turned the most dissapointing project into one of the best speeches I ever gave, and turned to whole thing around.

Our grade went from a 3.4 the previous day to a whopping 7.85.
