# ðŸŒŽ The presentation we used at the SE course

This was made by me and Darius, a colleague from my team, to which I want to thank.

I made this repository to serve as an everlasting memory of the presentation that turned the most dissapointing project into one of the best speeches I ever gave, and turned the whole thing around.

Our grade went from a 3.4 the previous day to a whopping 7.85.

The repo with the project: [https://github.com/Robert076/hms](https://github.com/Robert076/hms)

I will also hopefully refactor this and add it here.
